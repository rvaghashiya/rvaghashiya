### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a recent graduate student from the Department of Computer Engineering at Pandit Deendayal Energy University.

Iâ€™m a prospective MS student interested in applied artificial intelligence, primarily deep learning, computer vision, and generative networks. I am interested in the applications of AI in interdisciplinary studies and the design of inclusive and accessible intelligent health systems.
