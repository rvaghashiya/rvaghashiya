I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Saarland University.

My principal research interests include applied machine learning, primarily deep learning, and computer vision. I am interested in the applications of AI in interdisciplinary studies and the design of inclusive and equitable intelligent systems.
