### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Saarland University.

My principal research interests include applied machine learning, primarily deep learning, and computer vision. I am interested in the applications of ML in interdisciplinary studies to address real-world challenges and the design of inclusive and equitable intelligent systems.

Check out my [personal website](https://rvaghashiya.github.io/) for more details.
